This game is played by 2 players. One player uses X to mark his game moves, the other player uses O to mark his game moves.\
The game has a grid of 9 squares. Player X choses a square and marks it with an X. Then player O choses a square that is not marked with an X (or O) and marks it with an O. \
The goal of the game is to have 3  Xs /or Os in a row, column or diagonal. \
The game stops once there are 3 matching Xs or Os \
